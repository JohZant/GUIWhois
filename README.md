Spigot Plugin - Whois details in a GUI menu

## What is GUIWhois
GUIWhois is a plugin for SpigotMC servers that allows server staff to get easily viewable information on a specific player. 

Most servers already have a whois command that will print information in the chat box about the target. One of the issues with this is that the information can be moved off of the chat screen with all the players talking or even other plugins sending messages to the chatbox.

GUIWhois brings all the information of the players to a Minecraft Inventory which allows the staff member to see the information without worrying about it leaving the chat screen. Since the information is no longer in chat, the user's chat box will become less clogged and rather than entering the command multiple times to get updates, the player's information can be updated by refreshing the GUI.
